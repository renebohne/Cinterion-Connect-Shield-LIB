# Cinterion-Connect-Shield-LIB
Cinterion Connect Shield Library for Arduino Uno

This library simplifies the usage of LTE device available on Cinterion Connect Shield.

Find the device reference on https://developer.gemalto.com/documentation/cinterion%C2%AE-connect-shield-tools-documentation

Feel free to ask the community members all questions about the Cinterion Connect Shield


## Additional Sensors

On board is the temperature sensor NXP PCT2075 accessible via I2C address 1110 101
(0x75).

On board is the ambient light sensor Vishay VEML6030 accessible via I2C address 0010 000
(0x10).

On board is 4-bit port extender PCA9536TK accessible via I2C address 1000 001 (0x41). 
Three IO are connected to LEDâ€™s as output, while one IO is free for any usage on a test point.



## Start-up

For default configuration just put the Cinterion Connect Shield directly into Arduino Header without any shifts.
In that configuration pins assignment and usage by library is the following:

Arduino       | Cinterion Connect Shield
------------- | ------------------------
0 RX          | TXD
1 TX          | RXD
2             | RTS
3             | CTS
5 RX (Logger) | none
6 TX (Logger) | none
8             | PWR IND
9             | ON/OFF

Next download whole library and place it into directory where you have other arduino libraries. 
In your sketch add an include:  
__#include <LTECinterionConnectShield.h>__  
then create an object of class:  
__LTEConnectShieldModemc__   
and start using it. 

For more infomration please take a look into examples.

## Limitations
The Cinterion Connect Shield as default uses the main serial connection which is also use for Arduino programing.  
Therefore, if LTE device is enabled during Arduino programing (loading a new software) it may broke transmission and programing fails.  
Please turn off the LTE device in case of programing via ON/OFF button on shield - press for at least 3 second.

## Examples

This library contains a various of examples, please see [examples](https://github.com/David-Gemalto/Cinterion-Connect-Shield-LIB/tree/master/examples "Examples")

Basic example how to use Cinterion Connect Shield an register to network is avilable here:  
[AtCommandUsage.ino](https://github.com/David-Gemalto/Cinterion-Connect-Shield-LIB/blob/master/examples/AtCommandUsage/AtCommandUsage.ino "AtCommandUsage.ino") 

There are also two more examples, which shows how to prepare sketch for publishing and subscribing the MQTT messages:
